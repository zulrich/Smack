Smack
=====


Smack is an iOS app created by Zack Ulrich.

Allows users to keep track of sports video games scores among friends. 

The data is all stored on parse.com and integrates with Facebook so that users can add friends.

Currently has support for soccer teams. Has all teams available in Fifa 2013.

Hope to expand it to other popular games once it is approved on app store.
